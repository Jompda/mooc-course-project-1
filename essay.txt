FLAW 1:
https://github.com/Jompda/mooc-course-project-1/blob/f5d629570876d9004e9693fece4c749c7cf73703/server/pages/templates/pages/confirm.html#L23

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack leveraging browser authentication. The idea is that if a browser holds authentication information to a service, like a cookie or HTTP login information, a malicious actor can then send requests to said service which the browser then automatically authenticates. [1]

To filter out such requests, frameworks have begun providing single use tokens for the client. Should a request not have the correct token it should be deemed malicious. [2]
